# ocr-web-app
A simple OCR web application to process PDF files. Created following this guide: ![https://medium.com/@rjaloudi/building-an-ocr-application-with-node-js-pdf-js-and-tesseract-js-c54fbd039173](https://medium.com/@rjaloudi/building-an-ocr-application-with-node-js-pdf-js-and-tesseract-js-c54fbd039173). Currently set to support Estonian detection.

Uses Node.js, Tesseract.js, PDF.js and React. Created to become familiar with npm package management and all the frameworks & packages mentioned.

Currently doesn't get all the text; seems to have a problem with table-like objects.
